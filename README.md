# Flaskinni

### [Documentation](https://gilmour.gitbook.io/compsci/web-development)
This is meant to be an open-source starter kit for Flask applications. Flask is an amazing framework because it's so simple and minimal. It's a great way learn web development as can see all the scaffolding that Rails and other frameworks build for you. However, assembling the many helpful Flask modules can be a real chore. Flaskinni helps by bundling these resources. It's intended to serve as a starting point for students who have been studying Flask and are now ready to start a larger project.

### Install

Please see the [documentation](https://gilmour.gitbook.io/compsci/web-development) for detailed installation instructions. Or just wing it and figure it out. Look out for all the `settings.py` varibles you'll have to load in through a `.env` file.
